 * Tenemos dos tipos de classes para crear threads.
 * - Provide a Run object. The Run interface defines a single method,
 * run, meant to contain the code executed in the thread. The Run object
 * is passed to the Thr constructor. [implements].
 *
 * - Subclass Thr. The Thr class itself implements Run, though its run method
 * does nothing. An application can subclass Thr, providing its own implementation
 * of run [extends]
